# 🧠 Real-Time Collaborative Python Code Editor

This is a real-time, collaborative Python code editor where multiple users can simultaneously edit and execute Python code in one shared environment — ideal for pair programming, competitive coding practice, or learning together!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧑‍💻 Real-time code collaboration (multi-user editing)
- ⚙️ Python code execution via sandboxed Docker container
- 💻 Minimal, clean editor UI with syntax highlighting
- 📡 Fast backend powered by FastAPI & WebSockets

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS + JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket
- **Code Execution**: Docker (Python 3.10 container)

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

Follow the steps below to run the project on your machine.

### 🔁 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srevarshan05/python-server.git
   cd python-server
````

2. **Create a Python virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install all required packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Docker Desktop**

   * [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   * Make sure Docker is running successfully on your system.

5. **Pull Python 3.10 Docker image**

   ```bash
   docker pull python:3.10
   ```

6. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   > ⚠️ The terminal may show: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`, but **only use**:
   >
   > ```
   > http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   > ```

7. **Access the Editor UI**

   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

## 💡 What Can You Run?

* ✅ Competitive programming code (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
* ✅ Standard Python scripts
* ❌ Do NOT run code requiring additional libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow)
* ❌ No external file or internet access from within Docker
